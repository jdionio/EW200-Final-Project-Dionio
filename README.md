# EW200-Final-Project-Dionio
Zombie Shooter
The objective of this game is to survive as long as you can and get the highest score by killing all of the zombies!
To move, use the W, A, S, and D keys.
To shoot your weapon, aim the weapon at the enemy and use the left mouse button to shoot.
Each zombie takes 3 bullets to kill.
As you progress through each wave, more zombies will be added per wave.
Killing a zombie increases your score by 1 and increases your cash by 5.
You can use the cash in the shop to buy better weapons and kill more zombies!
Have fun!
